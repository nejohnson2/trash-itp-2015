      "Discarding materials is a practice deeply rooted in our society. It is such a natural act that we often give little thought to why we discard materials, why they lose their value and what happens to the materials after they have been disposed.  We are so accustomed to \"throwing away\" that we fail to see the complex global system which has tremendous environmental, political and social impacts.  Furthermore, the systems of waste production and disposal are intentionally hidden from public view in order to maintain this out of sight, out of mind mentality.  How then are we to recognize our intricate individual and collective relationship to trash?  How can we begin to explore these systems in order to understand their daily operation and mitigate their negative impacts?  By what means can we use to uncover the hidden life of trash?\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the seven weeks students will develop useful skills including problem identification, conducting research and communication by highlighting issues surrounding systems of reuse, recycling and trashing.  The course will explore the social, political and practical challenges of discarding items through readings, guest lectures, field trips and having students conducting their own project-based research culminating in a final project.\n",
